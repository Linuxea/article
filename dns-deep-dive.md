# DNS Deep Dive


## DNS Server

In real world, when you watching news, making online orders, downloading files or listening to live broadcasting, you need to visit the website by domain names, for example, youtube.com, google.com, ..etc. You must also remember the name of these website, not their IP addresses, because IP addresses are very difficult to remember, compare to website names. Therefore you need an website/domain name address book, which the the DNS server.


在现实世界上网冲浪，当你观看新闻，购物，下载文件或者听广播时，你需要通过域名来访问网站，比如 youtube.com, google.com 等等。

你必须记住它们的网址而不是 IP，因为相比下 IP 地址并不容易被记住。

因此你需要一个域名地址簿，也就 DNS 服务器。
